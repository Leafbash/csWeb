Instructions for creating a stand-alone version of csWeb:
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Install jxCore (the version I used is 2.3.7 / 32-bit)
2) Run updateAll.bat to make sure the latest changes are compiled.
3) Run 'gulp create_dist_of_client_and_server' which will create a 'dist'-folder.
4) Change the directory to that 'dist'-folder and run 'jx package server.js csServer -native --max-stack-size=1000000000'
5) Now a file 'csServer.exe' has been created, which will run the csWeb server. 
  To open csWeb:
    - run csServer.exe
    - open localhost:3002 in your browser

In order to be able to add/change/remove project files in the stand-alone version, it is recommended to 
move the dist/public/data and dist/public/images folders to a temporary folder before performing step 4). 
When csServer.exe has been created, copy the folders back such that you get the following structure
 > someFolder/csServer.exe
 > someFolder/public/images/*
 > someFolder/public/data/*

It is now possible to changes files in these to folders, after which csServer will use the changed files. This
is for example convenient when creating layer with the Excel2map tool.
