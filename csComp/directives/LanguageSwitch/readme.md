The language switch directive allows you to switch the GUI language interactively. Assuming you have created
a translation. you can add it easilyby taking the following steps:

1. Go to [FAMFAMFAM](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/flags/) and download the flag you need.
2. Go to [Base64 encoder](http://www.base64-image.de/) to encode your flag's png image.
3. Add the XHTML Image string to the LanguageSwitchCtrl translations.

I've added the directive to the index page, but you can take your own pick.

            <!-- Language switch -->
            <language-switch class="navbar-form navbar-right" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"></language-switch>
            <!-- Search form -->
